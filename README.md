# CircuitSymbols
I needed to be able to create circuit schematics and other diagrams to use in a book, video course and other materials. After issues finding a suitable set of symbols, and for free, I decided just to make my own. I am creating the symbols as I need them. I create the master file in Photoshop. I will save them in multiple formats (specifically PNG) as time permits.
